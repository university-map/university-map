introduction: >-
  Yale was established as the Collegiate School in 1701 by Congregationalist clergy of
  the Connecticut Colony. Originally restricted to instructing ministers in theology and
  sacred languages, the school's curriculum expanded, incorporating humanities and sciences
  by the time of the American Revolution. As of October 2020, 65 Nobel laureates, five Fields
  medalists, four Abel Prize laureates, and three Turing Award winners have been affiliated
  with Yale University. In addition, Yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five
  U.S. presidents, 10 Founding Fathers,
