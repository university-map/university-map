introduction: >-
  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) is a private land-grant research
  university in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The institute has an urban campus that
  extends more than a mile alongside the Charles River. The institute also encompasses
  a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, the Bates
  Center, and the Haystack Observatory, as well as affiliated laboratories such as the
  Broad and Whitehead Institutes. Founded in 1861 in response to the increasing
  industrialization of the United States, MIT adopted a European polytechnic university
  model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering.
  It has since played a key role in the development of many aspects of modern science,
  engineering, mathematics, and technology, and is widely known for its innovation and
  academic strength, making it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.
