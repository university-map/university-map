introduction: >-
  In 1909, the U.S. Congress agreed to reduce the Qing Dynasty's indemnity payments by US$10.8 million, on the condition that the funding be used as scholarships for Chinese students to study in the United States.
  Using this fund, Tsinghua College was established in Beijing, China, on 22 April 1911 on the site of a former royal garden belonging to a prince.
  After the Chinese Civil War, the Nationalist government reinstalled National Tsing Hua University in Hsinchu, Taiwan, which has since remained independent and distinct from Tsinghua University in Beijing.
