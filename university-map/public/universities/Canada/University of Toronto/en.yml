introduction: >-
  The University of Toronto is a public research university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,
  located on the grounds that surround Queen's Park. It was founded by royal charter in
  1827 as King's College, the first institution of higher learning in Upper Canada.
  Originally controlled by the Church of England, the university assumed its present name
  in 1850 upon becoming a secular institution. As a collegiate university, it comprises 11
  colleges each with substantial autonomy on financial and institutional affairs and
  significant differences in character and history. The university maintains three campuses,
  the oldest of which is St. George, located in downtown Toronto. The other two satellite
  campuses are located in Scarborough and Mississauga.
