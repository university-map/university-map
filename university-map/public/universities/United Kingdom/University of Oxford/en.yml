introduction: >-
  The University of Oxford is a collegiate research university in Oxford, England.
  There is evidence of teaching as early as 1096, making it the oldest university
  in the English-speaking world and the world's second-oldest university in continuous
  operation. It grew rapidly from 1167 when Henry II banned English students from
  attending the University of Paris. After disputes between students and Oxford
  townsfolk in 1209, some academics fled north-east to Cambridge where they established
  what became the University of Cambridge. The two English ancient universities share
  many common features and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge. The history and
  influence of the University of Oxford has made it one of the most prestigious
  universities in the world.
