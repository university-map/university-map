introduction: >-
  The University of Cambridge is a collegiate research university in Cambridge, United Kingdom.
  Founded in 1209 and granted a royal charter by Henry III in 1231, Cambridge is the second-oldest
  university in the English-speaking world and the world's fourth-oldest surviving university.
  The university grew out of an association of scholars who left the University of Oxford after a
  dispute with the townspeople. The two English ancient universities share many common features
  and are often jointly referred to as Oxbridge. The history and influence of the University of
  Cambridge has made it one of the most prestigious universities in the world.
