introduction: >-
  The university was established on 8 January 1842 by King William II as a royal academy, with the primary purpose of
  training civil servants for work in the Dutch East Indies. The school expanded its research and education curriculum
  over time, becoming a polytechnic school in 1864 and an institute of technology (making it a full-fledged university)
  in 1905. It changed its name to Delft University of Technology in 1986.
